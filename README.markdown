# jquery.placeholderlabels
This is yet another placeholder plugin.  It works similarly to tumblr's, and is a total rip off of this: http://jsfiddle.net/mrcoles/Kwsts/

I needed slight variations.  This is the result.

# jQuery Usage
Including the js file in an html document will automatically apply to any input/textarea which has a placeholder attribute specified.

# Angular Usage
Include module 'placeholderlabels' in your app.js
Include jQuery, and all of the placeholder labels js files in your project.
